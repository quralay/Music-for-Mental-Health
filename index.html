      The notion that music can influence your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
      probably does not come as much of a surprise. Music therapy is an
      intervention sometimes used to promote emotional health, help patients
      cope with stress, and boost psychological well-being. Some research even
      suggests that your taste in music can provide insight into different
      aspects of your personality.

          How Listening to Music Can Have Psychological Benefits
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Listening to music can be entertaining, and some research suggests
          that it might even make you healthier. Music can be a source of
          pleasure and contentment, but there are many other psychological
          benefits as well. Music can relax the mind, energize the body, and
          even help people better manage pain. The notion that music can
          influence your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors probably does not
          come as much of a surprise. If you've ever felt pumped up while
          listening to your favorite fast-paced rock anthem or been moved to
          tears by a tender live performance, then you easily understand the
          power of music to impact moods and even inspire action.

        <h5 class="card-title">Music Can Improve Cognitive Performance</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Research suggests that background music, or music that is played while
          the listener is primarily focused on another activity, can improve
          performance on cognitive tasks in older adults. One study found that
          playing more upbeat music led to improvements in processing speed,
          while both upbeat and downbeat music led to benefits in memory. So the
          next time you are working on a task, consider turning on a little
          music in the background if you are looking for a boost in your mental
          performance. Consider choosing instrumental tracks rather than those
          with complex lyrics, which might end up being more distracting.

        <h5 class="card-title">Music Can Reduce Stress</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          It has long been suggested that music can help reduce or manage
          stress. Consider the trend centered on meditative music created to
          soothe the mind and inducing relaxation. Fortunately, this is one
          trend supported by research. Listening to music can be an effective
          way to cope with stress. In one 2013 study, participants took part in
          one of three conditions before being exposed to a stressor and then
          taking a psychosocial stress test. Some participants listened to
          relaxing music, others listened to the sound of rippling water, and
          the rest received no auditory stimulation. The results suggested that
          listening to music had an impact on the human stress response,
          particularly the autonomic nervous system. Those who had listened to
          music tended to recover more quickly following a stressor.

        <h5 class="card-title">Music Can Help You Eat Less</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          One of the most surprising psychological benefits of music is that it
          might be a helpful weight-loss tool. If you are trying to lose weight,
          listening to mellow music and dimming the lights might help you
          achieve your goals. According to one study, people who ate at low-lit
          restaurants where soft music was played consumed 18% less food than
          those who ate in other restaurants. The researchers suggest that music
          and lighting help create a more relaxed setting. Since the
          participants were more relaxed and comfortable, they may have consumed
          their food more slowly and have been more aware of when they began to
          feel full. You might try putting this into practice by playing soft
          music at home while you eat dinner. By creating a relaxing setting,
          you may be more likely to eat slowly and, therefore, feel fuller
          sooner.

        <h5 class="card-title">Music Can Improve Your Memory</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Lots of students enjoy listening to music while they study, but is
          that such a great idea? Some feel like listening to their favorite
          music as they study improves memory, while others contend that it
          simply serves as a pleasant distraction. Research suggests that it may
          help. But it depends upon a variety of factors, including the type of
          music, the listener's enjoyment of that music, and even how musically
          well-trained the listener may be. In one study, musically naive
          students learned better when listening to positive music, possibly
          because these songs elicited more positive emotions without
          interfering with memory formation. However, musically trained students
          tended to perform better on learning tests when they listened to
          neutral music, possibly because this type of music was less
          distracting and easier to ignore. If you tend to find yourself
          distracted by music, you may be better off learning in silence or with
          neutral tracks playing in the background. Another study found that
          participants learning a new language showed improvement in their
          knowledge and abilities when they practiced singing new words and
          phrases versus just regular speaking or rhythmic speaking.

        <h5 class="card-title">Music Can Help Manage Pain</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Research has shown that music can be very helpful in the management of
          pain. One study of fibromyalgia patients found that those who listened
          to music for just one hour a day experienced a significant reduction
          in pain compared to those in a control group. At the end of the
          four-week study period, participants who had listened to music each
          day experienced significant reductions in feelings of pain and
          depression. Such results suggest that music therapy could be an
          important tool in the treatment of chronic pain. A 2015 review of
          research on the effects of music on pain management found that
          patients who listened to music before, during, or even after surgery
          experienced less pain and anxiety than those who did not listen to
          music. While listening to music at any point in time was effective,
          the researchers noted that listening to music pre-surgery resulted in
          better outcomes. The review looked at data from more than 7,000
          patients and found that music listeners also required less medication
          to manage their pain. There was also a slightly greater, though not
          statistically significant, improvement in pain management results when
          patients were allowed to select their own music.

              documentary, My Mind and Me: “I’m going to be very open with
              everybody about this: I’ve been to four treatment centers. I think
              when I started hitting my early 20s is when it started to get
              really dark, when I started to feel like I was not in control of

              a bombing during one of her 2017 shows. “I’ve always had anxiety.
              I’ve never really spoken about it because I thought everyone had
              it, but when I got home from tour it was the most severe I think
              it’s ever been.”

              Grande also spoke out May 2, 2021, in the hopes of ending the
              stigma surrounding mental health. “Here’s to ending the stigma
              around mental health and normalizing asking for help,” Grande
              captioned a mini gallery of text slides, which included numerous
              resources. “Healing isn’t linear, fun, quick or at all easy but we
              are here and we’ve got to commit to making this time as healthy,
              peaceful and beautiful as possible. the work is so hard but we are
              capable and worth it. sending so much love and strength.”

              What fans may not is that this popular Palette singer suffered
              from Bulimia Nervosa, a potentially life-threatening and harmful
              eating disorder, in the earlier days of her career. This also
              unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight. Moreover,
              she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to
              lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting
              project.

              In 2018, during her speech at the Golden Disc Awards, she urged
              her fellow artists to prioritize themselves and openly and
              honestly express their emotions - before comforting their fans (as
              the old adage goes, "help yourselves so that you can help
              others.")

              The BTS member opened up about his mental struggles back in 2016
              when he released Agust D, his first mixtape. In that mixtape, he
              built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had
              a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental
              health.

              Once again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA
              explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative
              emotions come and go. He added that people must be encouraged to
              share their mental health struggles, rather than silently
              suffering and keeping it to themselves.

      <h3>Books</h3>
      <div>
        Books are a powerful tool for therapy due to their unique ability to
        transport individuals into different worlds, perspectives, and
        experiences. They provide a safe and immersive space for readers to
        explore complex emotions, gain insights into their own struggles, and
        find solace in relatable characters and narratives. Through
        storytelling, books offer a sense of connection, empathy, and
        understanding, allowing readers to feel less alone in their challenges
        and fostering a sense of validation. Moreover, books offer a wide range
        of topics and genres, allowing individuals to find resources tailored to
        their specific needs and interests. The act of reading itself can be
        therapeutic, offering a respite from daily stressors and serving as a
        form of relaxation and self-care. Whether through self-help books,
        memoirs, or fictional works, books have the power to heal, inspire
        personal growth, and provide valuable guidance on the path towards
        mental and emotional well-being.

              Predictably Irrational explains the hidden forces that really
              drive how we make decisions, which are far less rational than we
              think, but can help us stay on top of our finances, interact
              better with others and live happier lives, once we know about
              them.

            <div>
              We make decisions daily and sometimes, we might not even think
              about the mechanism behind them. Humans are considered rational
              beings, but certain behaviours might end up making them…
              irrational, but in a predictable way, according to Ariely. This
              book will help you better understand your patterns of thought and
              who knows, maybe even break them.

                Thinking Fast And Slow shows you how two systems in your brain
                are constantly fighting over control of your behavior and
                actions, and teaches you the many ways in which this leads to
                errors in memory, judgment and decisions, and what you can do
                about it.

                Our minds are driven by two systems that influence the way we
                think. One system is fast and works on the emotional side, while
                the other one is a tad slower and makes more use of logic. These
                two systems work together to shape the way we think and to
                influence our decisions and Kahneman wants to reveal in this
                book how to cope with our brain.

                The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt

                The Happiness Hypothesis is the most thorough analysis of how
                you can find happiness in our modern society, backed by plenty
                of scientific research, real-life examples and even a formula
                for happiness.

                If you want to understand happiness, but you are not sure where
                to start, this could represent a good starting point. There are
                many sayings out there regarding happiness that we might have
                used naturally, but are they still available today? Haidt’s book
                is provocative and puts under analysis the way traditional
                wisdom interacts with the modern world.
