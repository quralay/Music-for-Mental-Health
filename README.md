# Music-for-Mental-Health
The Music for Mental Health project aims to help teenagers cope with stressors such as college applications, graduation exams, family issues, and other challenges. Recognizing the high incidence of suicides among teenagers, the project employs music therapy as an effective tool for stress relief and psychological well-being.
